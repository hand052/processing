//I decided to create a maze mini game, I wanted to make a 
//game because I like games and it follows with my major.
//Another reason I choose to do a maze was because i recently played a game
// that referenced the minotaur and his maze so I wanted to create 
//something based on it. I decided I wanted to create it for my family so they can
//see just how far I've come. I want people who play it (i.e. my family) to feel
//like they're traversing some large and expansive maze with possibly no end in sight,
//feeling like they were actually traversing the minotaur's maze. I want people to 
//play this game and think"Oh, how big is this maze and how long til I can get out".
//I would want people play this game on like a website, like a flash page.
